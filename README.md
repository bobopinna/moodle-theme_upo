UPO theme

This plugin is an extended version of Moodle 3.7 classic theme.
It adds several block regions in Moodle homepage:
- a banner region in the top of the page after the Navigation bar;
- a three columns regions called Home Left, Home Center and Home Right under the banner;
- a "Hidden" region, where you can put admin reserved blocks;
- a three columns regions after the main content called Footer Left, Footer Center and Footer Right.

This theme make the good companion with my block plugins: moodle-blocks_slideshow and moodle-blocks_informationspot

The banner region stretch all blocks to 100% of window width. 
Latest annuncements and RSS client blocks adapt them content horizontally.
